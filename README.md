# The Later List

## Concept and Motivation

The concept of our app originated from the hustle and bustle in everyday life and not always having the time to take a friend’s recommendation for a new movie, tv show, or podcast.

With our app, *“The Later List”*, users will be able to search for recommended podcasts, tv shows, or movies and save them to your list for when you have time later.
