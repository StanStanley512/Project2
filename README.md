# The Later List

## Why?

###### There's always new recommendations for a new TV Show, a movie, or a new podcast to listen too. Truth is, people are busy and sometimes it's tough to find free time to try these recommendations. In comes The Later List where you can search for recommended shows, podcasts, and movies and save them to your user profile to listen to later.

## How?

###### The app allows you to create a user profile or log in with your facebook, then you can search between movies or podcasts and save the recommended ones and any others that look interesting in the later list.
